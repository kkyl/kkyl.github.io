			<h1>User Research</h1>

				<h2>User Interviews</h2>
				<p>User interviews are important to gain an insight on users to know what these users are looking for and expect to see when looking at a professional portfolio, especially for a current student in college seeking a job in software development. The key is to create a portfolio they would want to see and can gain a lot of insight from. Questions included getting to know the users’ background, objectives and motivations, pain points, and use of the website (what they are looking for). The users interviewed included hiring managers in the industry and computer science college students. </p>

				<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
				<p> Competitor analysis is done to inspect what other competitors are doing and how they are doing it. Specific competitors were chosen to help develop an understanding of what elements work or do not work well, which can be applicable when creating the professional portfolio website. Both direct (other professional portfolios) and indirect competitors (other websites that satisfy a similar user need such as LinkedIn) were analyzed.</p>

				<h2>Feature Value Matrix</h2>
				<p>A feature value matrix organizes features based on business value, user value, and technical effort. The features were chosen based on what users expected to see (from interviews) and what elements worked well with other competitor products.</p>

				<h2>Feature Prioritization</h2>
				<p>Elements that provide the best business value, best user value, and least technical value had the highest priorities in feature prioritization. Information from the feature value matrix is compiled to create this. To build the website, the highest priority features were touched on first before hitting lower priority features. </p>

			<h1>User Testing</h1>
			<div class="col-6 col-12-s col-6-m boxing">
				<h2>User Stories</h2>
				<p>User stories help separate specific sets of features based on specific users to see how each relates to the user experience. These stories were approached by thinking about what users would be using the website for and what actions each user wants to do and accomplish with the task. Information from user interviews and cognitive walkthroughs contributed to these user stories.</p>

				<h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
				<p>Cognitive walkthroughs help focus on core features of a product and gain an insight on the user’s perception of how to accomplish certain tasks away from the developer’s perspective. Some challenges included forming a sequential order of task questions that seemed plausible and preventing users from trying to offer suggestions (and have them just focus on the task at hand). </p>

				<h2>User Test</h2>
				<p>Usabilityhub.com was used to perform two usability tests: one with navigation, and one with a 5 second test. The navigation test to find where the details about education are located was made to ensure educational background can be located (important for a young potential hire). The 5 second test was performed to see if the title page allowed users to remember key points (such as name and profile picture) and if what they saw intrigue them to continue looking at the rest of the content on the website. A challenge for this was having users that did not fully read the instructions before performing the test. Results showed that all people were able to identify at least the name and profile picture with the 5 second test, but some people had trouble finding where educational background is located on the website through the navigation test. </p>

		<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
			<p> 
				In user research, user interviews provided the most information. A software engineering manager who was interviewed mentioned how the website would mostly be used for secondary information after viewing a resume. With that, hirers would be looking for information that can be further explained outside of the resume. A program manager mentioned how the website should bring out personality to give her a feel on how they might work or fit with a team, a fellow student mentioned linear scrolling to easily access all information on the website, and a district manager in business mentioned having a personal statement to let the hirer know what a potential hire is looking for. Most users mentioned the importance of having a name, image, skills, education, projects, resume, contact, and work experience on the website. Competitor analysis revealed that a simple color scheme, minimalistic design, and clear sectioning worked well, and cluttered pages, a lack of images, lack of professionalism, and a missing profile picture did not work well. The feature value matrix and feature prioritization helped organize the data collected and pinpoint what information should be approached first for the website with “Name and Image” as the highest priority and “Images” as lowest priority.
				<br/><br/>
				Following with user testing after building the website, cognitive walkthroughs identified if users could find specific elements on the website and if they saw what they expected to see. Most users could identify the purpose of the website and find most sections. The most noticeable issue is some sections need more descriptive titles to help people locate where they want to find certain information, and some parts of a section, such as being a webmaster of a school club, can be put in both the projects and extracurricular sections in which the website link/code is included in the projects section. A “Reference” section to reference others the person has worked with was included based on user research, but after user testing, most users found the section unnecessary. The navigation was hard to read, and the resume button was not always easy to find. Some positives from users included enjoying the gridding system implemented with the borders around different activities and having a nice picture and personal statement at the top of the page. Usability tests simulated what users would click on and see first, which revealed that education information was not easy to find for a good portion of users. User stories helped narrow down what each type of user that might use the website would be doing to understand each user type’s own goals. All these elements of user testing revealed many faults that could be fixed and built upon.
				<br/><br/>
				In general, user research provided a good basis of understanding on what users expected to see. A realization from this is that what the user “expects” might not always be the best choice, as performing cognitive walkthroughs made some features, especially the “Reference” section, unnecessary. Many things might seem obvious or easy to find, but cognitive walkthroughs make a designer realize things that might seem obvious to a developer might not be obvious to the user. The feature value matrix and feature prioritization was an excellent way to break down what is needed for a website and to find the best approach to create a website, and user stories help a designer further picture what user actions would be done and what they expect out of it.

		<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
		<p>
			In implementation based on the findings, some sections were renamed. The “Other Experiences” section was renamed to “Extracurriculars” so the user will know these activities are not as related to software/career related activities and is geared more towards extracurriculars. The “Reference” section was removed, as many users found this section unnecessary. “Background” was changed to “Education/Skills” since many users had trouble locating educational information during the Usabilityhub test. “Profile” was changed to “Home” so users know it will redirect to the top of the page. 
			<br/><br/>
			The navigation bar was originally a light blue color, but since a user found it hard to read, it was changed to a darker color to be able to read the white text better. The font size was slightly increased. The contact and resume links under the profile picture were enlarged and put in caps to better locate, as some users found contact information and the resume hard to find. The color was changed from a light grey to dark blue to make it more noticeable and to indicate they were links. The company logos under the work section was changed to have a blue border around it to signify they were links, and clicking on these logos redirected to each company’s home pages. 
			<br/><br/>
			Some personal enhancements from own inspection included adding the research and user testing under the projects page to show a user that a lot of thought and knowledge was put in to create the site. A link to the GitHub page for the website I created for a club was included under projects. Unfortunately, some of the programs do not run on my personal desktop since it requires some installations of programs to run, but I hope to be able to set up the environments in the future to include more screenshots and code to previous projects I have made.
