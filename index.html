			<h2>Reader/Grader</h2>
			<h3>Computational Linear Algebra <br/> September 2017 - Present</h3>
			<p>
				I was selected as a reader/grader for a computational linear algebra class that I took two years prior. Through the job, I create homework solutions for the homework sets every other week and grade homework, labs (in MATLAB), and tests.

			<h2>Software Intern</h2>
			<h3>Panzura<br/>June 2016 - September 2016</h3>
			<p>I worked on a system to store system data collected from the company's products when tests are ran on the system. Two different methods, a data structure of Linked Lists and databases with SQL, were used to store the information. The email alert system to send error reports was modified to send information from this data collection rather than immediately after testing. </p>

			<h2>Software Intern</h2>
			<h3>Panzura<br/>June 2015 - August 2015</h3>
			<p>I helped develop a data model prototype for large data analysis for the company's product by focusing on the front end of the web application and connecting the data from a Python script that populated a database. Using Flask for AJAX calls between the UI and Python script and Git for source code control, data was extracted and displayed as graphs. HTML, Javascript, CSS, c3.js, and selectize.js were used for the UI.</p>

			<h2>Software Intern</h2>
			<h3>Panzura<br/>Jun 2014 - Sept 2014</h3>
			<p>I learned how to do simple white box test automation for the Web UI of the company's product. It required Jasmine.js for creating test cases and XML to store the defined test cases. I built an understand of the client/server relationship and how to implement simple quality assurance measures.</p>

			<h3>March 2017 - June 2017</h3>
			<p>I created and used a SQL database with a web application to constantly display and store data to and from the database. Tomcat helped provide the connection between the front end and back end. AJAX calls were used to quickly update. The web application allowed a user to search in an engine that had autocorrect features, and users can add to their cart and purchase movies.</p>

			<h2>Coordinator</h2>
			<h3>Urban Mótus (Dance Team)<br/> June 2017 - Present</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, I lead a team of hip-hop dancers with two other coordinators for an exhibition team at UCI. I have artistic say on the dance sets we do and make decisions for the team. Some noteable events that I am in charge of are auditions, performances, and team bonding events.

			<h2>Mentor</h2>
			<h3>Management and Information Student Society<br/> October 2016 - Present</h3>
			<p>
				My role as a mentor is to be there as a friend and to give school and professional advice in my field/major. This is my second year being a mentor for the program. I currently have a mentee this year and still keep in contact with the two mentees I had last year.

			<h2>Study Abroad</h2>
			<h3>Yonsei University - South Korea<br/>June 2017 - August 2017</h3>
			<p>
				Over the summer, I had the opportunity to study abroad in South Korea at one of the top three universities in the country. Overall, I learned a lot about the culture and opened my mind to a new environment that I was initially not as comfortable in. I learned to travel on my own and think quickly when new problems arise.

				<h2>Captain</h2>
				<h3>Urban Mótus (Dance Team)<br/> June 2015 - June 2017</h3>
				<p>
					My role as a captain was to help the coordinators make decisions and be the bridge between leadership and the team. As my first important leadership role in college, being a captain of the team helped me grow a lot as a leader. Now, I have become comfortable speaking aloud in front of a crowd and gained a lot of communication skills through working with the rest of leadership and interacting with members of the team.

				<h3>Taiwanese American Organization<br/> May 2015 - May 2016</h3>
